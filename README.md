# About
This program is a basic RSA Encryption-Decryption tool that accepts input from a user and using the RSA Algorithm, encrypts the message and then later decrypts it.

# Improvements and Future Work
* Expand the scope of the dictionaries used in encryption/decryption using unicode values and ASCII characters.
* Write more functions to generate the prime numbers and the value of e
* Include an interactive interface in implementing the program
